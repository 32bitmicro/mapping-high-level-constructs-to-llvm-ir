# Mapping Control Structures to LLVM IR

{todo: Add common control structures such as {c:if}, {c:for}, {c:switch}, and {c:while}.}

{todo: Explain the purpose of the {c:phi} instruction; show how it becomes obvious that you need it as soon as you encounter
multiple blocks that contribute a value through different temporaries.  In a way, `phi` ought to have been called "join" as it
sort of joins up subexpressions from different basic blocks.}

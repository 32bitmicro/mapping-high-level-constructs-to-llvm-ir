# Appendix C: Thank You

A brief list of all people who've contributed to the document (thank you all very much!):

* Dirkjan Ochtman (basically all the generator-related stuff by giving me some crucial samples).
* Eli Bendersky (for small grammar fixes and mention of `opt`'s `.bc` output).
* Sean Silva (for using proper C++11 lambda syntax in lambda samples).
* Isaac Dupree (for correction the name of '@': It is "at-sign", not "ampersand").
* Wilfred Hughes (`i` became `index` and addition of separator between generator C++ and LLVM IR code).
* Kenneth Ho (correction to C++11 lambda example and C++ exception handling sample).

Should your name be here?  If so, contribute :-)

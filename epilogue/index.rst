Epilogue
========

Remember that you can learn a lot by using the ``-emit-llvm`` option to
the ``clang``/``clang++`` compiler. This gives you a chance to see a
live production compiler in action and how it precisely does things.

If you discover something new this way, or any errors in this document
or you need more information than given here, please create `an issue at
Github <https://github.com/f0rki/mapping-high-level-constructs-to-llvm-ir/issues>`__
